# **App Name**: DomainSage

## Core Features:

- Authentication UI: Homepage with a clear title and Sign Up/Sign In buttons.
- Domain Selection: Domain selection screen (Education, Healthcare, Finance, Retail).
- AI Chatbot: Domain-specific chatbot interface for intelligent advice. The chatbot uses a tool to assess the situation and adapt its response to the user's need.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral white or light gray for a clean background.
- Secondary color: A professional blue (#3498db) for headers and important elements.
- Accent: Green (#2ecc71) for positive feedback and interactive elements.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for each domain.
- Use professional and relevant icons for each domain (e.g., a graduation cap for Education, a heart for Healthcare).
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience (e.g., loading animations for chatbot responses).

## Original User Request:
Develop an AI-driven consulting system that delivers expert-level guidance across four essential domains: Education, Healthcare, Finance, and Retail. The system should begin with a welcoming homepage that displays a clear title and includes Sign Up and Sign In buttons to authenticate users. Once authenticated, users are presented with the four domain options. Selecting any of these domains redirects them to a dedicated chatbot interface designed to offer intelligent, domain-specific advice. This chatbot should be trained using curated datasets tailored to each field, ensuring contextual and accurate responses to user queries.

The frontend of the application will be built using React.js, providing a dynamic, responsive, and interactive user experience. Styling and layout will be managed with Tailwind CSS, while Redux will handle application-wide state management, especially for user authentication and session handling. On the backend, a lightweight and efficient Flask server will be responsible for user authentication, processing API requests, and interfacing with the AI components. 

For the AI component, domain-specific chatbots will be powered by machine learning models built with TensorFlow and scikit-learn. These models will utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and interpret user queries, returning relevant and insightful responses. The models will be integrated into the Flask backend and exposed as RESTful APIs to be consumed by the React frontend.
